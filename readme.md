#Redispy Web
Uses [redispy](https://github.com/karlseguin/redispy) to display redis activity (via the [monitor](http://redis.io/commands/monitor) command). This is just a very basic monitoring tool. More of a framework to build something nicer.

#Getting it Running

	git clone git://github.com/karlseguin/redispy-web.git

	npm install
	coffee app.coffee
